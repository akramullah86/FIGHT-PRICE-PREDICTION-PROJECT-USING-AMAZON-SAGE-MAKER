**Flight Price Prediction Using Machine Learning**

As part of my continuous efforts to apply and enhance my data science and machine learning skills, I recently completed an exciting project focused on predicting flight prices. This project leverages various machine learning algorithms to forecast flight prices based on historical data and a range of features. Hereâ€™s an overview of the project:

**Project Overview:**

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast flight prices. By analyzing past flight data and extracting meaningful patterns, the model aims to assist travelers in making informed decisions about the best times to book flights.

**Data Source:**

The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle, which includes information such as departure and arrival times, flight durations, total stops, and airline details.


**Key Features:**

  - **Airline:** The airline operating the flight.
  - **Date of Journey:** The date on which the journey is scheduled.
  - **Source and Destination:** The airports where the flight departs from and arrives at.
  - **Route:** The path taken by the flight, including any layovers.
  - **Duration:** The total duration of the flight.
  - **Total Stops:** The number of stops during the flight.
    

**Tech Stack:**

  - **Python**: The core programming language used for data manipulation and model development.
  - **Pandas:** For data cleaning and preprocessing.
  - **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
  - **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
  - **Scikit-learn:** For implementing machine learning algorithms.
  - **XGBoost:** For building advanced gradient boosting models.
  - **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive development and visualization.
    
  **Methodology:**

  - **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, converting data types, and removing unnecessary columns.
  - **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing data, such as extracting the hour and minute from departure times.
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data to understand relationships and patterns.
  - **Model Building:** Implementing various regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
  - **Model Evaluation:** Using metrics such as RMSE and R2 Score to evaluate model performance and fine-tune hyperparameters.

**Results:**

The final model achieved an impressive accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting flight prices. Key insights derived from the model include the impact of the day of the week, airline, and duration on flight prices.

**Challenges:**

  - Handling missing values and categorical data.
  - Feature selection and engineering to enhance model accuracy.
  - Hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance.
  - Future Enhancements:
  - Deploying the model as a web application for real-time price predictions.
  - Continuous model improvement with more recent data and advanced algorithms.
    
  This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also provided practical insights into the complexities of flight price prediction. I am excited to share this project and look forward to applying these learnings to more real-world problems.
